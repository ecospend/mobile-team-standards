# Version Control

These standards define how version control is applied to our code.

Wherever possible these standards follow built-in versioning facilities for the languages, tools or frameworks we are using.

## Rationale

- Underpins a consistent, robust and repeatable release strategy
- Provides showcases common development scenarios and how to deal with them from a branching point of view.
